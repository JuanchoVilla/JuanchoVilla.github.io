<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>This site was created with the intention of making the World Wide Web a little more rad. There's too many big players. This is my way of protesting the commercialization of one of the most precious resource known to mankind.</p> 

<p>Supporting the movement is easy, all you have to do is create. Not on someone else's platform, on your own. Let's take back the internet.</p>

<p>If you don't know where to get started, send and email to me@juancarmona.dev</p>

<p>This site was put together using Sapper with love &lt;3</p>
